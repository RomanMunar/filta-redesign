## Appreciation

- Consistent Colors and spacing
- Plenty of white space, made the site feel breathable
- The introduction is on point
- Provides learning materials
- Great Grammar, clear on the value/service you give.

## Needs to change, asap

- Introduce icons
- Introduce gray shades
- De-emphasize body texts by desaturating it
- Change underlined links to simply have arrow icons
- [Contact Section](https://filtaglobal.com/#contact)
  - Black over white, bad for the eyes
  - It does not look like a form
  - Change the color of placeholders on input fields
- Change the slider on the testimonial section.

## Nitpicks

- Lack of visual cues for navigating the site
- Images competes with the content for attention
- The site is too long, remove a few sections.
- Contact form should not be at the bottom
- Center the headlines on a section and don't use diagrams on negative spaces.
