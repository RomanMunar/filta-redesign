# Filta Redesign

---

## Appreciation

- Consistent Colors and spacing
- Plenty of white space, made the site feel breathable
- The introduction is on point
- Provides learning materials
- Great Grammar, clear on the value/service you give.

## Needs to change, asap

- Introduce icons
- Introduce gray shades
- De-emphasize by desaturating body texts
- Change underlined links to simply have arrow icons
- [Contact Section](https://filtaglobal.com/#contact)
  - Black over white, bad for the eyes
  - It does not look like a form
  - Change opacity of placeholders on input fields
- Change the carousel on the testimonial section.

## Improvements

- Lack of visual cues for navigating the site
- Brand colors (namely, #000 with #FEA500 ) should not be used to display content.
- Images competes attention with the content
- Contact form should not be at the bottom
- There are no clear hierarchy to where a user should look first
- Center the texts and don't use diagrams on negative spaces.
- Add a \`_Our Process_\` section
